# Professional Portfolio

* WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or     avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

* WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application

* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
